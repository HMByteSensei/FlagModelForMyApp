# Animated Flag in Blender 🏳️

This project features an **animated flag** made in **Blender** that I made in order to use it in [EduAugmentedReality](https://github.com/HMByteSensei/EduAugmentedReality). Whole project was created as part of the Computer Graphics course.

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Cloth physics simulation** for natural waving motion.  
- **Smooth keyframe animation** to enhance realism.  
- **Optimized for AR applications**, particularly for use in the **EduAugmentedReality App**.  

## 📂 Files  
- `animated_flag.blend` – Blender project file.  
- `flag_export.fbx` – Exported model with animation for AR applications.  
- `Flag-Portugal.jpeg` – Textures used for the flag material.  

## 🔧 How to Use  
1. **Import the `.fbx` file** into your AR project.  
2. **Ensure your AR engine supports animated models** (e.g., Unity, Unreal Engine).  
3. **Adjust lighting and rendering settings** for best visual results.

## 📌 Dependencies  
- Blender 3.x (for modifications).  
- A compatible AR framework (Unity ARKit, ARCore, or a custom solution).  

## 📖 About the Project  
The final animation was designed for use in **[EduAugmentedReality](https://github.com/HMByteSensei/EduAugmentedReality)** to enhance interactive learning experiences.
